            <p>CEBU, Philippines — AppleOne Medical Group (AMG), the healthcare arm of the AppleOne Group of companies, has set out to upgrade the laboratory services and medical arts of VisayasMed Hospital in Cebu City in partnership with Singapore Diagnostics (SGD).</p>

        <div class="headlines">
            <h1>Headline</h1>
            <p>“Reeling from the pandemic where we saw the paramount need for quality health and laboratory services, we at AppleOne, are honored to work together with SGD. With our goal of enriching the lives of Filipinos, we will be working together in expanding SGD’s services to other AppleOne Medical Group Hospitals across the VisMin region. Our patients can be more assured of the highest standards of quality competence and safety when it comes to their laboratory tests.” said AppleOne chief finance officer Leif Bajarias. <br>
            <br>
            Through its partnership with SGD, VisayasMed Hospital will be able to carry out its main goal of providing a holistic patient experience by offering a more convenient and personalized approach to healthcare as SGD is known for its global expertise and technology. 
            <br>
            SGD will fully operate VisayasMed’s laboratory, both inpatient and outpatient, through their well-trained medical technologists and laboratory specialists. Additionally, SGD also aims to become a well-equipped training venue for the best scientists of Cebu for continuous improvement. <br>
            <br>
            VisayasMed Hospital, formerly known as Visayas Community Medical Center, is a private tertiary hospital with close to 70 years of healthcare experience in providing quality medical services to patients. It comprises five main departments namely family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and other departments that offer services from medical professionals in dermatology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, and anesthesiology. <br>
            <br>
            SGD, on the other hand, is the Philippine flagship company of Singapore-based healthcare group, Pathology Asia. It is the first laboratory in the Philippines accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), which makes it at par with the worlds’ best laboratories and has been awarded as Healthcare Asia’s Diagnostics Provider of the year and STATISTA’s Philippines’ Growth Champion of the year. <br>
            <br>
            From its establishment in late 2013, Singapore Diagnostics (SGD) has grown to be among the largest laboratories in the Philippines. Processing laboratory tests for over 300 hospitals, clinic labs and healthcare institutions in the Philippines, SGD serves up to 50,000 patients every month. <br>
            <br>
            With the goal of furthering its corporate mission of enriching the lives of Filipinos while also seeking to elevate industry standards, AppleOne saw the need to venture into a new sphere: healthcare, an industry in need of support and one with tremendous opportunity for growth in the country. <br>
            <br>
            In July of 2020, AppleOne Medical Group went into a joint venture partnership with the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) for the acquisition, management and operations of Visayas Community Medical Center (VCMC) in order to revitalize and further bring forth the mission of the hospital to its local communities. <br>
            <br>
            VCMC, a well-regarded institution that has been a beacon of hope in Cebu for over 70 years now, was steered in its new direction under the tutelage of newly appointed CEO, Jun Amistoso, as part of AMG’s first order of business. Among the new platforms are the expansion, modernization and enhancement of the facilities and services of the hospital. <br>
            <br>
            AMG has also partnered with the United Shalom Hospital in Tacloban city, which suffered an immense devastation due to typhoon Yolanda in 2013. Through AMG, it was able not only to survive, but also expand its services and modernize its facilities, making it a premier health and wellness facility in the area. <br>
            <br>
            The most recent to be added to the AMG portfolio is the Brokenshire Hospital in the heart of Davao city. Brokenshire is a Level 3 general hospital with a 200-bed capacity and is among the few that specialize and offer in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in the country.  AMG likewise aims to bring state-of-the art facilities into the hospital and expand its services.</p>
