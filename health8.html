            <p>MANILA, Philippines — As Filipino Christians observe the Lent, the Department of Health on Monday issued reminders to keep the Holy Week safe and healthy.</p>

            <h1>Headline</h1>
            <p>During the Holy Week, many Filipinos go home to their provinces or travel to tourist destinations. Others perform religious penance, believing the practice would cleanse sins and grant wishes. <br>
            <br>
            The DOH urged those staying at home to do the following: <br>
            <br>
            - Eat adequate and nutritious food <br>
            - Exercise <br>
            - Use the long weekend to rest, reflect and do worthwhile activities <br>
            <br>
            Amid the summer heat, people who will head out and conduct Visita Iglesia — or the practice of visiting at least seven Catholic churches on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday — should keep in mind the following: <br>
            <br>
            - Make sure that the vehicle and the driver are both in good condition <br>
            - Bring handkerchief, water, fan, and umbrella. <br>
            - Use sunblock to prevent sunburn <br>
            - Plan the destinations carefully to avoid mishaps <br>
            - Pregnant, senior citizens, and those with comorbidities are advised to stay at home <br>
            - Ensure those who you will interact with are vaccinated against COVID-19 <br>
            <br>
            The health department has these pieces of advice to devotees who will perform religious penance: <br>
            <br>
            - Make sure that you’re vaccinated with anti-tetanus <br>
            - Thoroughly clean the utensils that will be used <br> 
            - Assess yourself before attempting to fast <br>
            - Opt for a safer act of penance </p>
