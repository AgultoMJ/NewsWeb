The stories of how Tanggol would get into trouble, or his relationship with his barkada, were my experiences, too,” he said.\r\n\r\nInspiration\r\n“His relationship with his father and mother was similar to mine when I was younger.

This means I am able to deliver, that I am doing something right,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe was sure he wouldn’t be able to surpass the success of “FPJ’s Ang Probinsyano,” which aired for seven years, but he was surprised to find out that “Batang Quiapo” is doing better than the former, ratings-wise. “Compared to the ratings of ‘Probinsyano’ during the time ABS-CBN first lost its franchise, ‘Batang Quiapo’ still did better with its first episodes. This pleases us very much. Even the views on YouTube keep getting higher and higher. We are all grateful for the support.”\r\n\r\nThe series also features Christopher de Leon, John Estrada, Lorna Tolentino, Lou Veloso, McCoy de Leon, Ronnie Lazaro, among others.
