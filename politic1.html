            <h1>Headline</h1>
            <p>MANILA, Philippines — Data breach fears over the computer systems of law enforcement agencies have convinced a senior lawmaker that the country should do away with requiring police or National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearances for employment. <br>
            <br>
            Albay Rep. Joey Salceda cited the recent report of a data breach that exposed the personal data of some one million Filipinos “stored in an exposed and compromised database of the Philippine National Police (PNP).” <br>
            <br>
            “Frankly, the PNP and other law enforcement agencies should not be in the business of storing the personal data of law-abiding citizens. And besides, that distracts from their law enforcement functions,” said Salceda. <br>
            <br>
            The chair of the committee on ways and means of the House of Representatives said that instead of putting ordinary law-abiding citizens through the “hassle and expense of clearances, as well as the risk of data breach, why don’t we normalize due diligence among employers?” <br>
            <br>
            “Otherwise, you have a system where no good deed goes unpunished. For following the law, you are hassled with having to prove it. That’s insane,” he said. <br>
            <br>
            Salceda said these clearances can be abolished for most cases, to help minimize “personal data collection whenever we can.” <br>
            <br>
            “You have under 100,000 crimes in the country every year. But 99.9 percent of the population has to get a clearance saying they do not have trouble with the law,” he said. <br>
            <br>
            It “really makes no sense” to require jobseekers to submit clearances, aside from the costs that it entails “and it’s a waste of time for employers,” he added.</p>
