            <p>UNITED NATIONS – Some 67 million children partially or fully missed routine vaccines globally between 2019 and 2021 because of lockdowns and health care disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations said Wednesday.</p>

            <h1>Headline</h1>
            <p>“More than a decade of hard-earned gains in routine childhood immunization have been eroded,” read a new report from the UN’s children’s agency UNICEF, adding that getting back on track “will be challenging.” <br>
            <br>
            Of the 67 million children whose vaccinations were “severely disrupted,” 48 million missed out on routine vaccines entirely, UNICEF said, flagging concerns about potential polio and measles outbreaks. <br>
            <br>
            Vaccine coverage among children declined in 112 countries and the percent of children vaccinated worldwide slipped five points to 81 percent -- a low not seen since 2008. Africa and South Asia were particularly hard hit. <br>
            <br>
            “Worryingly, the backsliding during the pandemic came at the end of a decade when, in broad terms, growth in childhood immunization had stagnated,” the report said. <br>
            <br>
            Vaccines save 4.4 million lives each year, a number the United Nations figures could jump to 5.8 million by 2030 if its ambitious targets to leave “no one behind” are met. <br>
            <br>
            “Vaccines have played a really important role in allowing more children to live healthy, long lives,” Brian Keeley, the report’s editor in chief, told AFP. “Any decline at all in vaccination rates is worrying.” <br>
            <br>
            Before the introduction of a vaccine in 1963, measles killed approximately 2.6 million people each year, mostly children. By 2021, that number had fallen to 128,000. <br>
            <br>
            But between 2019 and 2021, the percentage of children vaccinated against measles fell from 86 percent to 81 percent, and the number of cases in 2022 doubled compared to 2021. <br>
            <br>
            The slide in vaccination rates could be compounded by other crises, Keeley warned, from climate change to food insecurity. <br>
            <br>
            “You’ve got increasing number of conflicts, economic stagnation in a lot of countries, climate emergencies, and so on,” he said. “This all sort of makes it harder and harder for health systems and countries to meet vaccination needs.” <br>
            <br>
            UNICEF called on governments “to double-down on their commitment to increase financing for immunization” with special attention on accelerating “catch-up” vaccination efforts for those who missed their shots.</p>
