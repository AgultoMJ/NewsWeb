            <p>In the many years that I have been working, this feels like the first year where I cannot withstand the heat. Back then, I used to cover the El Ni√±o so extensively, even going to the rice fields of Bohol and the sugar mills of Negros Oriental to check on their situation. </p>

            <p>Today, even the heat inside the classroom is intolerable. <br>
            <br>
            When I come to think of it, I am a bit lucky because I only have to give or take 26 students inside a cramped room. There is a small air conditioning unit that could only give so much cool air on a hot summer day. I resort to opening all the windows instead but still it is very uncomfortable. Who am I to think about comfort? When in the public schools, the teacher's ratio reaches up to 50 students. There are only fans that are giving off air which is still humid. Too much movement will drain the energy out of both the teacher and student. <br>
            <br>
            The Department of Education has reiterated that they are giving schools the authority to suspend classes as they see fit. This means that when it is too hot for everyone to be on campus, they can also opt to shift to another mode of learning. However, if this season persists until the month of June, how much longer can they take? <br>
            <br>
            While I see nothing wrong with new modes of learning, I personally think that it is not as efficient as meeting the student face-to-face. It is only an avenue for cheating and procrastination. Leaving assignments and exercises for them to do in their equally-hot homes won't do the trick. They would rather play and enjoy the summer season outdoors or in the water. <br>  
            <br>
            That is why I resonate with some groups that are lobbying for the return of the school year from June to March. This would give students some time to enjoy the summer season in the country for the remaining months. However, they are very much concerned with our alignment with the global system --as if we can reach global standards. <br>
