                <p>The Covid-19 positivity rate in Metro Manila is still rising, according to the most recent monitoring of the OCTA Research.</p>

            <h1>Headline</h1>
            <p>OCTA Research fellow Dr. Guido David reported on Thursday, April 27, that Metro Manila's seven-day positivity rate increased from 8.4 percent on April 19 to 13.4 percent on April 26. <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, he does not completely rule out the possibility that Metro Manila's Covid-19 positivity rate will continue to rise in the days to come. <br>
            <br>
            “This is expected to increase further, perhaps up to 20 percent,” David said. <br>
            <br>
            The OCTA fellow previously stated that the Covid-19 Omicron subvariant XBB.1.16 spreading in the country may be the cause of the increasing Covid-19 cases. <br>
            <br>
            Positivity rate refers to the number of individuals who yielded positive results from among those who have been tested for Covid-19. <br>
            <br>
            The benchmark for the positivity rate set by the World Health Organization is 5 percent. <br>
            <br> 
            On Thursday, the Department of Health announced 781 new Covid-19 cases across the country. <br>
            <br>
            David projected that the country may record 900 to 1,100 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, April 28.</p>
